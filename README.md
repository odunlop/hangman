# Hangman

## About The Project
This project was based off of making a playable version of Hangman in Ruby using what I had learnt in the first three weeks of my Makers Apprenticeship. The basic functionality I wanted from this project was...
* A word is randomly selected (this will be a one-player game)
* A user can guess one letter at a time
* If they guess wrong - one step closer to a completed hangman
* If they guess right - all matching letters filled in 
* User wins once all letters are guessed in time

## Built With
* Ruby
* RSpec

## Usage
To be written once completed
